This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4843

The idea for wirting this script came up as I have to maintain an old but very huge and undocumented program in which some messages was produced depending on its number by simple do a 'CALL FEHLER(nnn);' where nnn was a number.

Unfortunately this calls weren't in order and coded somewhere between approx 12000 lines of code, and it was necessary to have the numbers unique of course but some weren't, and there were approx 400 numbers used.

So I thaught about how I could get just the numbers and nothing else to examine them, and this made the script CopySel, which does I needed.

There are 2 versions I supply:
The comfortable version uses my VDLGBX.DLL (vimscript #755).
The 'nude' version simple uses your last search and is stuck to th q-register.
